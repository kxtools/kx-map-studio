The definitive, open-source desktop application for Guild Wars 2 players to easily **create, edit, and manage their in-game marker routes**!

Tired of manually editing complex XML files for your Guild Wars 2 routes? KX Map Studio is here to make your life easier. Whether you're making a simple farming path, an achievement guide, or a detailed route for your guild events, our tool provides a visual, user-friendly way to get the job done.

## What is KX Map Studio?

**KX Map Studio** is a standalone application built for Guild Wars 2 players who want to take control of their in-game routes. It replaces the tricky, manual process of editing marker files with a smooth, visual interface. It's especially useful for:

*   **Route Creators:** Build custom paths, achievement guides, or event routes from scratch with ease.
*   **Route Customizers:** Easily tweak existing marker files from your favorite content creators.
*   **KX Trainer Users:** Create and fine-tune your own marker files for seamless integration with KX Trainer's teleport features.

> ✅ **100% ToS Compliance:** KX Map Studio uses only the official Guild Wars 2 Mumble Link API to access in-game data. It does **not** perform memory reading or DLL injection.

## Key Features (v0.1.0)

Our first early release focuses on providing a solid, user-friendly experience for managing single marker files:

*   🗺️ **Visual Map Editing:** Interact with your markers directly in a clear, organized interface.
*   📝 **Simple Properties Editor:** Easily change marker details like position, map ID, and type using friendly controls.
*   ➕ **One-Click Marker Placement:** Add your current in-game position as a new marker with a single click or hotkey (requires Guild Wars 2 running).
*   🔄 **Undo/Redo:** Experiment with confidence, knowing you can always undo your last changes.
*   📂 **Flexible File Handling:** Open, edit, and save standard GW2 marker XML files (`.xml`) or even unpack existing `.taco` archives.
*   💾 **Safe Saving:** Your changes are saved cleanly, preserving the original structure of your files as much as possible.

**Future Feature Alert!** We're planning an integrated **live in-game preview overlay** to let you see your route changes in real-time as you edit!
